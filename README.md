# Rock Paper Scissors

This project uses Node.js and HTTP to create a simple server that handles user interactions through a web browser. All of the server logic is handled with Node.js built-in modules.

**How to use**

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `app.js` to start the server
3. Open the browser at `localhost:4001/?name=YOUR_NAME`
4. Start playing by selecting 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'

> [!NOTE]
> The game output appears in the browser's console

Feel free to customize and enhance the project as needed. Have fun playing Rock-Paper-Scissors!
