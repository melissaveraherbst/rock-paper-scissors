# Rock Paper Scissors

This project uses Node.js and HTTP to create a simple server that handles user interactions through a web browser. All of the server logic is handled with Node.js built-in modules.

### How to use

1. Navigate to the folder where you want the cloned directory.
2. Open your terminal and paste the following:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/melissaveraherbst/rock-paper-scissors.git
    ```
    
4. Run `app.js` to start the server
5. Open the browser at `localhost:4001/?name=YOUR_NAME`
6. Start playing by selecting 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'

> [!NOTE]
> The game output appears in the browser's console
