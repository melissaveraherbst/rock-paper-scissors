# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Objective
Using the http module, we will build a simple HTTP server. We will practice how to route requests based on pathname and request methods. We will also be using other core Node.js components in this projectâ€”we will use the fs module to stream HTML files and create an URL object to extract queries from a URL.
